When building Liquid Remix for a GSI, the following must be done.

1. These lines have to be commented out of device/liquid/sepolicy/common/private/file_contexts:

/system/bin/fsck\.exfat                 u:object_r:fsck_exec:s0
/system/bin/fsck\.ntfs                  u:object_r:fsck_exec:s0

2. In build/core/config.mk, comment out the lines above and below the inclusion of BoardConfigLiquid.mk so it looks like this:

#ifneq ($(LIQUID_BUILD),)
include vendor/liquid/config/BoardConfigLiquid.mk
#endif
